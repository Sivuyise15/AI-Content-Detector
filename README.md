AN AIContentDetector - to detect AI generated content, and give probability. This project uses transformer models from HuggingFace.
Warning: Use this at own risk as many models are not as accurate with detecting AI content, and so it should only be used for learning purposes. I bare no costs for any damage that using this projects may create.
